---Concatonation

The concat() method joins two or more strings.

"a" + "b" = "ab"

var w = "cd"
        d      c
var x = w[1] + w[0] //"dc"

var newW = w[i] + newW


---Pushing and popping

var str ="we ran" 
var strSplit = str.split(" ") 
var words = ["we "," ran "] 

words.push(strSplit[0]) 
words.push(strSplit[1]) 

console.log(words.pop()) 
console.log(words.pop())


---Traditional Loops

Backwards
for (var i = array.length-1; i >= 0; i--) { 
    console.log(array[i])
}

Forwards
for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { 
    console.log(array[i])
}

p0 initialization: var i = 0
p1 conditional: i < array.length
p2 body: { ... }
p3 inc/dec: i ++

first iteration: p0, p1, p2, p3
p1, p2, p3
p1, p2, p3
...
last iteration: p1

---Function---
function add(x, y) {
    // write var for each parameter 
    // var x = (value passed in for x)
    // var y = (        "       for y)

    return x + y
}
add(1, 2) 
---Habits in need of Adjustment

1. Align code, ALIGNMENT.
2. Write 1 comment per goal, 
3. Write 1 line of code,  
4. Select more sensible and straight forward descriptive variables,
5. Change all variables with F2
6. test in debugger, 
7. Use all developer's tool controls when stepping thru code
8. start process all over 
9. variable must exist before use, unless a variable is declared within a function, it does not exist outside that function  
10. A function must return something
11. 
12. Code executes in the same order a page in a book is read 
13. Use sketch pad and pencil to draw out what your code is doing and what you want it to do.

You have to know what your code is doing
